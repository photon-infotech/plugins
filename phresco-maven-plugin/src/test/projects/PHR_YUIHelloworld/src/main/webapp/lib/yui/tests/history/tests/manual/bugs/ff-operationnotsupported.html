  Firefox: Operation Not Supported
</h1>

<p>
You should see an alert saying "it works", whether this page is loaded over HTTP
or from a file:// URL.
</p>

<p>
If you don't see the alert, or if you see an "Operation is not supported" error
in the console, this test has failed.

var Y = YUI({
  filter: 'RAW',
  combine: false
}).use('history', function (Y) {
  alert('it works');
});
