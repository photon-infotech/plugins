h1. Usage

The common usage is to simply declare the plugin and its goals. 
The process-sources and process-test-sources phases will be bound to by default:

{code}
<project>
  ...
  <build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
      <artifactId>jslint-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${projectVersion}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>jslint</goal>
            <goal>test-jslint</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
{code}
